#   mutants    every mutants/*.patch must make one of its checks fail. A

#              the checks are trace, safety-1, cap, liveness-f1, liveness-f2,
#              tried in order until one fails. Each check a mutant names is
#              first run once on the unmutated model, and a check that fails
#              there kills nothing (reported as not killed); the executor
#              checks are exempt (no VIEW: the unmutated run does not
#              finish), `run.sh executor` is their baseline. The report
#              names the killing check and why (invariant, temporal,

#              disappeared).

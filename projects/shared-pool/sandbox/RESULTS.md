# shared-pool sandbox layer: results (v1.1.0)

Runtime evidence on the real wasm. `pool_contract.wasm` and `pool_executor.wasm`
are built from the pinned source mirror (57b3f02, clean; tree identical to the
v1.1.0 PR head 6fcbd56) by the documented build, upstream `scripts/build.sh`.
They run in a local near-sandbox 2.13.4 through near-workspaces 0.23.0, the
versions upstream `crates/sandbox` pins. Evidence class: **test** (near-approval
strategy §12). Every test also keeps a host-side `pool_core::Pool` in step with
the chain. That is the real core, used as an oracle. After each step the test
compares the whole `get_pool` state with it, so the tests cover the shell and
core together, not the shell alone.

The v1.0.0 record (two builds, findings SB-1 and F-1 reproduced) is in git at
a072a2d and in PR #31; this file replaces it.

Runner: `projects/shared-pool/sandbox/run.sh`. Exit 0 means every check passed.
It runs these steps in order:

1. `scripts/check-lock.py`. The sandbox `Cargo.lock` was seeded from the mirror's
   lockfile, and all 342 shared registry packages match it.
2. `scripts/build-wasm.sh`: runs upstream `scripts/build.sh` in the mirror
   (with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `RUSTFLAGS` and `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` cleared,
   so nothing outside build.sh changes the build). build.sh sets
   `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg near"`, checks both import sections against its reviewed
   list, and writes `artifacts/build.json`. The script then requires
   `dirty: false`, `source_commit` = the mirror's HEAD and `rustflags` =
   `--cfg near`, copies both wasm files to `target/pool/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`,
   and requires the copies to hash to build.json's sha256. One variant,
   `upstream`: v1.0.0's second variant `cfg-near` is what build.sh itself now does.
3. `scripts/build-res.sh`, which builds the helper contract `relay/`.
4. `scripts/sandbox-bin.sh`, which supplies a sha256-checked near-sandbox binary.
5. `tests/runtime.rs` (13 tests), then `tests/resources.rs` (RES-1, 2 tests).
   `SANDBOX_SKIP_RES=1` skips RES-1.

Each test writes its observations to `results/upstream/<ID>.json`.

## Artifacts under test (`results/wasm.json`)

rustc 1.98.1 (48a229cea 2026-09-01); `cargo build -p pool-contract -p
pool-executor --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --locked` with

Every failure any test expects must read `Smart contract panicked: <msg>`
(`expect_panic` in `tests/common/mod.rs`); a bare `unreachable` trap fails the
test. Core errors are matched exactly (`NotFound`, `Pending`, ...); Rust
`assert!`/`expect` messages, which near-sdk prefixes with `panicked at
<file>:<line>:`, are matched by containment.

### RT-PRED

Unchanged from v1.0.0 and passing on the v1.1.0 wasm:

- An actor signs `relay.forward(submit)`. The pool attributes the call to the
  relay: the decision event's `actor` is the relay, the result is
  `Unauthorized`, and storage is byte-identical.
- The same request sent directly by the actor is accepted.
- When the relay is a recipe's actor, a forward signed by an unrelated account
  is accepted as the relay's submit.
- `dispatch`, `cancel`, `settle` (even when signed by the executor's key),
  `set_paused` and `observe` (signed by the owner) are all rejected
  `Unauthorized` when they go through the relay. None of them writes anything.

### RT-PRIVATE

- `get_pool` before `new` fails "The contract is not initialized".
- `pool.new` fails "Method new is private" for the owner, the actor, an
  unrelated account and the executor, and through the relay when the
  transaction is signed with the pool's own key. `exec.new` behaves the same
  way. A second `new` by the contract's own account fails "The contract has
  already been initialized". Storage is unchanged in every case.
- `on_result` fails "Method on_result is private" for four foreign callers and
  for the relay.
- **Changed in v1.1.0.** On the pool's own key, `on_result` is now **Ok**: the
  wrapper reads the raw promise results, a transaction carries none, so the
  count is not 1 and the result is "unknown". Observed: on an Unknown record
  the event is `{id, outcome: "unknown", error: null}` and storage is
  unchanged; on an **Active** record the same event, and the record stays
  Active with storage unchanged; for an id never issued (999) the event carries
  `error: "NotFound"`. Only the deployment account's own key can send this, so
  it falls under ASM-PRIVATE.
- **EX-8, sandbox half.** The executor's `on_settled({id: 600})` fails "Method
  on_settled is private" from the owner, the actor, an unrelated account, the
  lock account and the relay. From the executor's own key it passes the
  private check and fails `not a settle callback` (the promise-result count is
  0, not 1). The executor's raw storage is unchanged in every case. RT-D1
  covers the "advances only on an accepted settle" half.

### RT-CALLBACK

Each row is executor mode → result of `execute` → effect on the record.

- **normal** → "active" → Active. The reservation is kept; the executor holds
  the job as "active".
- **reject** → "cancelled" → Cancelled through `settle(executor, false)`. The
  reservation is released exactly.
- **unknown** → the executor stores the job and returns "unknown" → Unknown.
  `cancel` then fails Pending. `reconcile`, signed by an unrelated account,
  reads "active" → Active; repeating it is a no-op.
- **panic** → `execute` fails "injected failure" → the callback has no
  successful result → Unknown. The dispatch transaction itself succeeds and the
  reservation is kept. `reconcile` reads "unknown", a no-op.
  `confirm_not_executed` releases it: receipts executor `[ok, ok]` (the call,
  then `on_settled`), lock `[ok]` (`settle`).
- `finish` has three receipts in v1.1.0, in this order: `finish`, the lock's
  `settle`, then the executor's `on_settled`. The test checks the executor's
  jobs and `newest` after each step: final jobs `[(0, completed), (1,
  cancelled), (2, cancelled), (3, cancelled)]`, `newest` 3.
- **NT-F4, fixed** (`rt_callback_non_string_executor_results`, record
  `RT-CALLBACK-nonstring`). Upstream's hand-assembled executor wasm
  (`integration.rs` `non_string_executor`, ported with its MIT attribution;
  sha256 `7608bb67…6ec2`) returns the JSON number `5` from `execute` and a
  70-byte JSON string from `status`. Both map to "unknown": the dispatch
  succeeds and the record goes Unknown; the reconcile is a no-op with storage
  unchanged. The executor account's own `settle(0, false)` then releases it.

### RT-REVERT

Ten core errors through the wasm all panic with the error name. For each one
the pool's raw storage is byte-identical before and after, and the transaction
emits no event:

- Unauthorized, NotFound and InvalidState on `dispatch` and `settle`
- Unauthorized and Pending on `cancel`
- Unauthorized on `set_paused`
- Pending on `observe`

The same holds for: Paused on `dispatch`; Bounds on `observe` with three bad
inputs. Rejected submits (Paused, Stale, InvalidUnits, Unauthorized) do not
panic: they return a decision, emit one `decision` event and write nothing.

New in v1.1.0:

- `cancel` of a Completed record fails InvalidState (conflicting terminal
  evidence), storage unchanged.
- **NT-F2, fixed.** `reconcile` with 1 yoctoNEAR attached fails "Method
  reconcile doesn't accept deposit"; no receipt reaches the executor and
  storage is unchanged.
- **F-5, fixed.** The pool's `version` is patched to `VERSION_CAP` =
  u32::MAX − 768 = 4294966527 (reaching it takes about 2^32 transitions), with
  one Reserved and one Active record. `set_paused`, `observe` (restating the
  current values) and `dispatch` each fail Arithmetic, with no event, no
  executor receipt and storage byte-identical; the core gives the same error.
  `preview` returns `allowed: false, reason: Arithmetic`, equal to the core
  (v1.0.0's preview said allowed and submit panicked), and `submit` returns that
  rejected decision without a panic. The open records still resolve: `cancel`
  of the Reserved one and the operator's `finish(true)` of the Active one are
  both Ok (version CAP + 2). With every record terminal, `observe` still fails
  Arithmetic.
- A pruned id's `dispatch` gives NotFound with storage unchanged (RT-WINDOW).

### RT-RACE

1. **Settle before the callback (deterministic).** The executor is the helper
   contract `relay/`, which runs `settle` from inside `execute`. On one shard
   `settle` lands first, every time, and the late "active" ack is a no-op: the
   version moves by +2 (dispatch, settle), where the callback-first order would
   give +3. This holds for `settle(true)` and `settle(false)`, and for a stale
   `reconcile` read (+1). Reconciling a terminal record fails InvalidState.
2. **Timed race with the upstream executor contract.** The executor account's
   own key signs `settle` 0–400 ms after `dispatch` is broadcast. Every serial
   order the core allows was observed (settle before dispatch: InvalidState;
   dispatch, settle, callback: the late ack ignored; dispatch, callback,
   settle). The test fails if the late-ack order never occurs.
3. **Timed race with the operator's `finish`.** Two outcomes only: "finish
   before execute" (`finish` fails "unknown job", one receipt; a later `finish`
   succeeds), or "callback first, then finish → settle → on_settled". For every
   accepted `finish` the test checks the three receipts and that `on_settled`
   raised the executor's `newest` to the id. `finish` returns the lock's
   `settle` value and `on_settled` runs as a separate callback, so the async
   outcome is re-polled until `on_settled` has run (`complete` in common/;
   near-workspaces' own await can return before it). On one shard the notify
   cannot overtake the callback: a gap, not a failure.

### RT-WEDGE

Both v1.0.0 wedges are fixed on the wasm (LIVE-2 holds on these paths).

- **F-1** (`rt_wedge_f1_refused_and_cure_settles`). The brief's configuration:
  `observe [12, 5]` (metric 0 above its max 10), then the hedge
  `r(actor, exec, [-2,0], [2,-5], 1, [])`. v1.1.0 refuses the submit `Bounds`
  (preview and core agree; storage unchanged), so nothing is dispatched
  (`dispatch(0)` fails NotFound, the executor has no job) and `observe [5, 5]`
  is Ok. The cure-by-completion hedge of upstream `findings.rs:175`
  (`r(actor, exec, [0,-1], [-3,0], 1, [])`) is admitted at `[12, 5]`
  (values `[12, 4]`), dispatched (Active), and settles through the operator's
  `finish(true)` (receipts `[ok, ok]` / `[ok]`): Completed, values `[9, 4]`.
  `finish(false)` afterwards fails "terminal outcome conflict" and changes
  nothing; `observe [5, 5]` is Ok.
- **F-2** (`rt_wedge_f2_honest_release_after_the_hedge`, record
  `RT-WEDGE-F2`). Upstream's `risk` fixture (`fixtures.rs`) with credit, equity
  and macro accounts, in two forms: the position Reserved, and the position
  dispatched with the executor panicking (Unknown). The hedge is sized as if
  the position were released: 8 and 7 units are refused Bounds, 6 (the core's
  `best_quantity`) is admitted. The position's honest release (`cancel` when
  Reserved, `confirm_not_executed` when Unknown) is Ok in both forms, nothing
  wedges, and `observe [60, 40, 30, 40]` is Ok after.

### RT-WINDOW

F-3, fixed, end to end (port of upstream `integration.rs`
`window_of_300_records_through_the_executor`, with formalver's core comparison
after every step).

- 300 records go through the executor: ids 0–9 and 290–299 in normal mode
  (dispatched, Active, then the operator's `finish(true)`: Completed), the rest
  in reject mode (`execute` returns "cancelled" and `on_result` releases the
  record: Cancelled).
- Final pool: `first_id` 44, 256 records (Cancelled 246, Completed 10),
  `completed_units [20]`, version 920. The executor holds exactly ids 44..=299
  (256 jobs); the most jobs ever held was 256.
- EX-7 is checked after every transaction (620 checks): every id the executor
  has seen and the lock still retains is still a job; `get_jobs` equals the
  executor's borsh state; at most 256 jobs; every job satisfies
  `id + 256 > newest`.
- Checkpoints at records 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 255, 256, 257, 299 record
  `first_id`, the record count and the exact job-id range.
- Pruned id 0: `dispatch`, `cancel`, the executor key's `settle` and
  `reconcile` each fail NotFound with storage unchanged; the executor's
  `finish(0)` fails "unknown job", `confirm_not_executed(0)` fails "stale id",
  and `status(0)` returns "unknown".
- `get_commitments` pages across `first_id`: `(0, 50)` and `(44, 50)` give
  44..=93, `(290, 50)` gives 290..=299, `(300, 50)` is empty, and `(100, 100)`
  gives 100..=149 (the limit is capped at 50).

### RT-D1

D-1 (owner decision Q4) on the real runtime: port of upstream
`integration.rs` `confirmed_failed_executes_keep_the_executor_at_256_jobs`.

- **Deviation from upstream:** the executor's operator is a separate account,
  not the owner, so the roles stay distinct; the owner's `set_mode` fails "only
  independent operator".
- The executor panics on every `execute`. For each of 300 records: `dispatch`
  (receipts executor `[fail]`, lock `[ok, ok]`; the record goes Unknown), then
  the operator's `confirm_not_executed` (executor `[ok, ok]`, lock `[ok]`; the
  record is Cancelled and `on_settled` raises `newest` to the id).
- At upstream's ten checkpoints (confirmations 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 255,
  256, 257, 299) the exact job-id list is asserted. The executor never holds
  more than 256 jobs; EX-7 is checked after every transaction (606 checks).
- Then: id 43 (pruned): `confirm_not_executed` fails "stale id" and `finish`
  "unknown job", storage unchanged. A refused confirmation of id 10000:
  executor `[ok, ok]`, lock `[fail]` (NotFound), the job is kept and `newest`
  stays 299; the lock's storage is unchanged (`on_settled` takes the refused
  branch: EX-8). `on_settled` from foreign accounts fails "Method on_settled is
  private". Id 300 confirmed while Reserved is refused InvalidState; its later
  `dispatch` gives "cancelled" → Cancelled; the operator's `finish(300, false)`
  is accepted and forgets job 44. Id 301 goes end to end (Completed).
- Final pool: `first_id` 46, 256 records (Cancelled 255, Completed 1),
  `completed_units [1]`.

### SB-1 (fixed)

`sb1_documented_build_reports_panic_messages` (inverted from v1.0.0's
`sb1_upstream_build_loses_panic_messages`). On build.sh's wasm no failure is a
bare trap; each carries its message: `Method new is private`, `Unauthorized`,
`NotFound`, `Bounds`, `Method on_result is private`, `only independent
operator`, `Method on_settled is private`, `Pending` (cancel and observe), and
`Method reconcile doesn't accept deposit` (NT-F2). v1.0.0's record of the
finding (every failure "WebAssembly trap: An `unreachable` opcode was
executed.") is `results/upstream/SB-1.json` at a072a2d.

### RES-1

Method: upstream `crates/sandbox/tests/res1.rs` at the pin (which upstream
adapted from this layer's v1.0.0 test), ported back with formalver's two-test
split. Acceptance thresholds: upstream `docs/api.md:44-59`, the gas table.
Upstream's own figures (the table's, and upstream's `artifacts/res1.json`
from that run, kept as `.context/shared-pool/v1.1/res1-q4.json`) are compared
as an informational cross-check: gas is deterministic for an identical wasm
and protocol version, and upstream measured the hashes above. **Every
documented figure, and every figure in upstream's res1.json, was reproduced
exactly.**

The state is built with real transactions only (no state patching):

- 32 metrics with 128-byte names and units, 64 terms, 32 recipes with
  128-byte names, 64-byte actor and executor ids, full 32-entry effect
  vectors, recipe *i* requiring every *j < i*;
- (A) 31 Completed prerequisites (recipes 0–30 × 1), then recipe-31
  reservations of 100 units up to 255 records;
- (B) the 256th submit (no prune), then 31 more submits that each prune a
  Completed front record, so the pool retains 256 open records and the next
  submit is rejected `Full` (nothing written; core and chain agree);
- (C) `set_paused` both ways, `observe` restating the values, `cancel` of the
  oldest record and one more submit: ids 32..=287 retained, all open.

At 256 open records: `STATE` is 45,749 bytes of Borsh, the account's
`storage_usage` 423,334 bytes, and `get_pool` returns 53,401 bytes of JSON
(upstream's res1.json: the same three numbers).

**Test 1, `res_1_gas_at_max_state`** (`results/upstream/RES-1.json`), every
call at 300 Tgas:

| call | receipts (Tgas) | tx total |
|---|---|---|
| submit #256 (224 open records, no prune) | pool 14.02 | 14.33 |
| submit #257 (prunes id 0) | pool 14.05 | 14.36 |
| submit #287 (255 open records, prunes the last Completed record) | pool **14.81** | 15.13 |
| submit #288 (rejected Full) | pool 8.10 | 8.41 |
| preview at 255 records (as a transaction) | pool 6.70 | 7.01 |
| get_pool (as a transaction) | pool 9.85 | 10.15 |
| get_commitments(0, 1000) → ids 31..80 | pool 3.85 | 4.16 |
| set_paused(true) / (false) | pool 7.59 / 7.59 | 7.89 / 7.90 |
| observe (restating the values) | pool 7.71 | 8.02 |
| cancel (release; 255 other open records) | pool 10.87 | 11.18 |
| dispatch | pool 8.29, on_result 7.63, execute 1.43 | 18.10 |
| reconcile (Active, a no-op) | pool 4.15, on_result 7.63, status 1.23 | 13.76 |
| dispatch, execute returns "cancelled", on_result releases | pool 8.29, on_result **10.92**, execute 1.35 | 21.31 |
| dispatch, execute fails, on_result marks Unknown | pool 8.29, on_result 7.62, execute 1.29 (fails) | 17.95 |
| executor finish(true) | finish 2.12, on_settled 1.37, settle **10.87** | 15.11 |
| executor confirm_not_executed | 2.12, on_settled 1.37, settle 10.86 | 15.11 |
| settle(true) / settle(false) by the executor key | pool 10.84 / 10.83 | 11.15 / 11.14 |

- The worst pool receipt is submit #287 at 14.81 Tgas (docs: "largest receipt
  14.81 Tgas (a `submit` with 255 open records)"), 15.19 under the documented
  30 Tgas attach for `submit`, `cancel`, `settle`, `observe` and `set_paused`.
  Every pool receipt in both tests is under 30 Tgas (asserted).
- Submit gas grows with the open records the envelope sums: 7.33 Tgas at 1
  record, 10.30 at 128, 14.02 at 256 (no prune), 14.81 with 256 open after a
  prune (`submit_gas_by_submit` in the record).

**Test 2, `res_1_min_prepaid_gas_and_executor_cap`** (`results/upstream/RES-1-gas.json`):
the least whole-Tgas prepaid gas, counting up from 40 Tgas.

| call | state | fails at | least that succeeds | docs least | docs attach | margin to attach |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dispatch` | 256 records, all open; executor 31 jobs | 40–69 | **70** | 70 | 100 | 30 |
| `reconcile` | 256 records, the record Active; executor 3 jobs | 40–45 | **46** | 46 | 60 | 14 |
| `confirm_not_executed` | executor 254 jobs (255 after); the record Unknown | 40–54 | **55** | 55 | 70 | 15 |
| `finish` | executor 256 jobs, the last job | 40–54 | **55** | 55 | 70 | 15 |
| `finish` | executor 512 jobs (its cap) | 40–55 | **56** | 56 | 70 | 14 |

- Each of the 84 failing attempts fails in its first receipt with the
  runtime's "Exceeded the prepaid gas.". For each one the test checks: no
  receipt runs on the other contract; no log and no event; the raw storage of
  both the pool and the executor is byte-identical; `get_pool` still equals
  the core, and the record keeps its status.
- After failed attempts at 40 and 69 Tgas on a second record, a 300 Tgas
  `dispatch` succeeds; a third record succeeds again at exactly 70 Tgas. The
  `dispatch` receipt burns 8.29 Tgas with 70 or with 300 Tgas prepaid: the
  gas attached to promises is fixed.
- Each least amount is at least 10 Tgas below its documented attach
  (asserted); each equals the documented least (recorded, `matches_docs`).
- **Promise receipts** (docs/api.md's second bullet), all under their
  attached gas (asserted): `on_result` at most 10.92 of 30 (a release),
  `execute` 2.46 of 30 (the 256th job), `status` 1.76 of 10 (256 jobs), the
  lock's `settle` after `finish` or `confirm_not_executed` at most 10.87 of
  40, `on_settled` 2.47 of 10.
- **The executor at its cap (512 jobs).** Reached as upstream does: the
  operator confirms the 256 unassigned ids 289..=544; each adds a "cancelled"
  job, the lock's `settle` fails NotFound (the lock's storage unchanged) and
  `on_settled` takes the refused branch (`newest` stays 287). The confirmation
  from 511 to 512 jobs burns 4.39 Tgas; one more fails "full" on the executor
  and never reaches the lock. At 512 jobs `status` burns 2.29 of 10,
  `finish` 4.39 with `on_settled` 3.68 of 10 (3.66 after a refused settle), and
  `execute` of a new id (288, after the front record 32 is finished and pruned)
  3.65 of 30: it forgets job 32 and adds 288. All equal docs/api.md.
- **`on_settled` under 6 Tgas** (upstream's `ON_SETTLED_LIMIT`, asserted for
  every measured one, including all 256 refused ones): largest 3.68 Tgas,
  6.32 Tgas of margin to the 10 attached.
- The executor's `STATE` is 5,745 bytes of Borsh at 256 jobs and 12,145 at

## What is NOT shown

- **Multiple shards and congestion.** The sandbox is a single node with a
  single shard. On mainnet, receipt order across shards, and under congestion
  or delayed receipts, can differ. The late-ack order was produced
  deterministically with the helper executor and by timing with the executor
  key, not with the operator's `finish`, which cannot overtake its callback on
  one shard.
- **Other protocol versions.** Gas is near-sandbox 2.13.4's protocol
  configuration. Other protocol versions price differently.
- **Proof of the worst case.** RES-1's maximum state is a constructed worst
  case, not a proven one. The least prepaid gas is measured at that state only,
  in whole Tgas, for `dispatch`, `reconcile` (256 open records),
  `confirm_not_executed` (254 jobs) and `finish` (256 and 512 jobs). The
  methods that create no promise (`submit`, `cancel`, `settle`, `observe`,
  `set_paused`) were run at 300 Tgas only; their largest receipt is compared
  with the documented 30 Tgas attach.
- **Out of scope here (near-tests' mocked runtime covers them):** expiry by
  block time (`Expired`, `SnapshotExpired`) and deposits on methods other than
  `reconcile`.
- **Storage staking.** The 50 NEAR pool and executor accounts held their
  largest states; storage staking limits were not probed.
- **Live deployment.** Nothing here touches testnet or mainnet, deployment
  locks, or code replacement (ASM-DEPLOY).

## Run times (this machine, macOS arm64)

On 2026-11-14, `run.sh` with warm caches took 1041 s in total and exited 0.
build.sh's `cargo build` was a no-op on the mirror's cached target; its import
check and build-wasm.sh's hash checks still ran. The steps took:

- `check-lock`, `build-wasm`, `build-res`, `sandbox-bin`: a few seconds.
- `tests/runtime.rs`: 13 tests in 509.5 s with 3 test threads, each test in
  its own sandbox. RT-D1 (about 500 s) and RT-WINDOW (about 320 s) set the
  pace: each sends over 600 transactions and reads both contracts' state after
  every one (EX-7).
- `tests/resources.rs` (RES-1): 2 tests in parallel in 523.4 s, each building
  the 256-record state with about 360 real transactions (163 s for A-C);
  `res_1_min_prepaid_gas_and_executor_cap` sets the pace (about 970
  transactions in all, 84 of them low-gas attempts). Upstream's single test took 469
  and 524 s (fix-1.md).

`SANDBOX_SKIP_RES=1` leaves about 8.5 minutes. The relay helper is
`sandbox_relay.wasm` sha256 `15756aac597357de320d8973ba88f050c46f4aa4250c92d83c138c8e07b6150c`.

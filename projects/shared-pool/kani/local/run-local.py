"""Run shared-pool's large Kani harnesses and mutants on this machine (and record them).

The jobs are the kani-large groups' harnesses and the kani-mutants-large
mutants of .github/workflows/shared-pool.yml (measured peaks above 13 GB,
which ubuntu-latest cannot hold in memory), each with its matrix timeout as
KANI_TIMEOUT. Each job is kani/run.sh (`kani <harness>` or
`mutants --kani 'NN-*'`) from an exact copy of the commit's Kani inputs
(git archive of projects/shared-pool/kani, conformance/traces/core.txt and
the repository's .cargo/config[.toml] above kani/ if it has any, and of
the source-mirror submodule at the commit's gitlink), one copy per lane,
with its own KANI_LOG_DIR and KEEP_LOGS and KANI_DEFER_COVERS=1. At
most --lanes jobs run at once, and only while their measured peaks
(kani/RESULTS.md) sum to at most --budget-gb; the longest start first.
Memory is sampled every 3 s: the run.sh process tree and its largest cbmc
process. run.sh is used as it is; KANI_MAX_GB stays its default (40) unless
set in the environment. The mutant jobs run with RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN set to
tools/versions.env's RUST_TOOLCHAIN (their plain mode), as CI's
kani-mutants jobs do; the harness jobs without it, as CI's kani jobs.

The fingerprint does not see the environment, so the run refuses to start
when a variable that changes what run.sh runs or how cargo builds is set
(KANI, KANI_FLAGS, KANI_MOD, RUSTFLAGS, CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS,
RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN, RUSTC, RUSTC_WRAPPER, RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER,
CARGO_BUILD_*, CARGO_PROFILE_*, CARGO_TARGET_*_RUSTFLAGS), or when a cargo
configuration file outside the lanes (CARGO_HOME's, or a .cargo/ above the
run directory or TMPDIR) sets rustflags, rustc or a wrapper (at any depth,
such as target.<triple>.rustflags), a profile, or an include. The files
are parsed as TOML, as cargo reads them, so every spelling of those keys
(quoted, dotted, an inline table) counts, and one that does not parse is
refused too. That includes the work tree's own (such as
kani/.cargo/config.toml) when the run directory is inside the repository,
the default: cargo would read it on top of the lane's copy of the
commit's. Then pass --out outside the repository. env.txt records the
other KANI_* variables and those files.

usage: run-local.py [--out DIR] [--rev REV] [--lanes N] [--budget-gb GB]
                    [--record] [--dry-run] [--all [--only JOB,...]]
  --out DIR      output (default kani/target/local-run/run-<UTC time>)
  --rev REV      the commit to run (default HEAD)
  --record       when every job passed, run record.py DIR (writes kani/local;
                 then commit it)
  --dry-run      check the environment and cargo configuration as a run
                 does, print the jobs and exit
  --all          a measurement of every harness and mutant, not a record
                 (below)
  --only JOBS    with --all: only these jobs (comma-separated harness names
                 and mutant-NN)

Output, as record.py reads it: env.txt (commit, kani-tree, core-pin, tool
versions, host, lanes, budget, start and end), jobs.json, progress.log
(ends with ALL DONE), results.tsv (job kind lane start_utc secs rc verdict
peak_tree_gb peak_cbmc_gb est_peak_gb est_secs; a harness's verdict is
run.sh's result, a mutant's expect/plain/kani with "!" if run.sh flagged it
UNEXPECTED), logs/<job>/ (stdout.txt, covers.tsv, the Kani and plain logs).
About 4 hours for the 36 harnesses and 16 mutants on a 10-core, 64 GB Mac
with the defaults. Needs Python 3.11 or later (tomllib, for the cargo
configuration), Kani and its CBMC at tools/versions.env's versions
(cargo install --locked kani-verifier --version <KANI>; cargo kani setup),
the Rust toolchain RUST_TOOLCHAIN (rustup toolchain install <RUST_TOOLCHAIN>
--profile minimal) and the source-mirror submodule (git submodule update
--init projects/shared-pool/source-mirror).

A measurement (--all) is not a record: it sizes the matrices (their 13 GB
split and timeouts) before a record is made. Its jobs are every harness of
the commit's `run.sh list` and every one of its mutants/*.patch, not the
matrices'. Each job's peak and time are estimated from the best source,
named in jobs.json and estimates.tsv: W7's measurements of the v1.1.0
Kani layer (V11_MEASURED); then, for a harness whose name is unchanged,
v1.0.0's kani/RESULTS.md, its peak times 1.25 (v1.1.0 measured up to 1.53
times v1.0.0's, h_init); a mutant from the harnesses its Kani leg is
expected to run (its first killed-by, or every checked-by of a
`# must-survive` patch) plus 240 s of plain mode and build; otherwise
unknown: 40 GB (KANI_MAX_GB, the most run.sh lets a job use), so that it
runs alone or beside a job estimated at 10 GB or less, and 1800 s. A
job's limit (KANI_TIMEOUT) is 3 times its estimate, at least 1800 s, and
at least 7200 s for run.sh's 7200 s tier and for an unknown; a mutant's
is the largest of its harnesses'. KANI_MAX_GB stays 40 (another value is
refused). The run holds /tmp/sp-heavy.lock (SP_HEAVY_LOCK) from its start
to its exit, failures and signals included, so that no other heavy job
overlaps it: while another process holds it, the run waits (checking
every 30 s), and it removes only a lock it took. --record is refused; the
output is outside the repository (default
~/shared-pool-kani-measure/all-<commit>-<UTC time>), env.txt says `mode
measurement`, and record.py refuses it. The lanes, the environment and
cargo checks, the sampling and results.tsv are the record's. --dry-run
prints the jobs, their estimates and the estimated hours.

%%   spec.md                    cited as spec:<line>
%%   api.md                     cited as api:<line>
%%   verification-handoff.md    cited as handoff:<line>
%% v1.0.0 text that v1.1.0 deleted is cited as spec@v1.0.0:<line> (likewise
%% api@, handoff@): the findings, the closed divergences and the threats'
%% history. The v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0 line map is .context/shared-pool/v1.1-verify/
%% docmap.tsv; the two low-similarity rows were checked by hand:
%%   spec@v1.0.0:46 -> spec:48. v1.0.0 "A checked inverse can fail if another
%%     commitment depends on its contribution ... resolve dependent work first
%%     ... In the supplied fixtures ... prevent ordinary unsafe reliance on
%%     unexecuted work" is deleted. spec:48 ("Admission refuses any commitment
%%     whose outcomes could make a metric worse than now, so the checked
%%     inverse cannot fail in a reachable state. There is still no forced
%%     administrative release.") replaces it with the opposite claim; the cap
%%     half is spec:50; the fixture sentence's successor is spec:70's last
%%     sentence (risk) and handoff:23.
%%   handoff@v1.0.0:31 -> handoff:34. v1.0.0 "A rejected checked inverse
%%     release leaves liability intact. Liveness is conditional on resolving
%%     dependencies and receiving authoritative evidence." is deleted;
%%     handoff:34 ("... no completion or release can fail the bounds check
%%     (LIVE) ... Liveness is conditional only on authoritative evidence and
%%     gas.") is its successor, without the dependency condition.
%% Every fact carries the line it was transcribed from. Where the docs are
%% silent the fact says so: Basis code_only(Why) means the docs give no
%% condition, name or position, and the code's choice is recorded so that
%% the check can still be exact (and so the gap is visible: C-2 and C-3 count
%% them). doc_condition(Cite) means the docs state the condition but not the
%% error name or the position. Readings the text leaves open are AMBIGUOUS;
%% places where the docs and the code disagree are divergence/4 facts (none
%% at v1.1.0; the v1.0.0 ones are closed_divergence/5).
%%
%% INDEPENDENCE NOTE (ASM-SPEC). Unlike near-approval's M4, the author of this
%% layer had read the code (the shared brief transcribes it). Doc-backed facts
%% are cited to the doc line that states them; nothing marked doc(_) relies on
%% the code. The code-only facts are the code's choices and are labelled.

requirement('S-ADM-EFFECT', 'spec:27', "On success append a Reserved record with id first_id + len(records), replace values, increment version; if 256 records are retained, first drop the oldest, which is terminal, and increment first_id; on rejection return an error with no state change.").

requirement('S-VERSION-RESERVE', 'spec:50', "Submit (as its last check, so preview reports it), dispatch, set_paused and observe fail Arithmetic once version reaches VERSION_CAP = u32::MAX - 768; acknowledgment, settlement and cancellation keep the plain checked increment and never overflow; at the cap the pool admits nothing new but every open record can still be resolved.").
requirement('S-NOEXPIRY', 'spec:52', "No automatic expiry of a dispatched request; reconciliation queries the fixed executor by immutable id; Unknown is distinct from cancelled.").
requirement('S-ADAPTER', 'spec:54', "The mock adapter binds id to recipe/quantity, dedupes identical dispatch, rejects a different payload; it forgets a job only once its id is 256 or more behind the newest id the lock vouched for; only the lock executes; only the operator finishes/cancels; it stores terminal evidence before notifying the lock.").
% spec.md, External observations and administration
requirement('S-PAUSE', 'spec:58', "set_paused is owner-only and increments version; pausing blocks new admissions and dispatch, not settlement or reconciliation.").
requirement('S-OBSERVE', 'spec:58', "observe is owner-only; it sets new values only when every record is terminal; restating the current values is allowed at any time and renews the snapshot timestamp; it replaces bounded measured values without changing policy; it can create a hard-limit violation.").

% spec.md, Scenario semantics
requirement('S-GPU', 'spec:64', "GPU/Friday: coverage and occupancy include reserved and completed bookings; completion does not free historical slots; Friday also consumes dispatch slots atomically.").
requirement('S-STOCK', 'spec:66', "Inventory: positions move at reservation; source availability decreases and transit increases at reservation; receipt moves transit into destination availability; incoming position is never available stock; available_depot + available_A + available_B + transit = 12 across ordinary transfer transitions.").
requirement('S-CASH', 'spec:68', "Hiring: reservation consumes funds or earmark and increases coverage plus escrow; acceptance moves escrow to paid; coverage remains after payment; free + earmark + escrow + paid + protected = 10; review needs completed research >= 2 and implementation >= 3; no worker can authorize its own acceptance.").
requirement('S-RISK', 'spec:70', "Risk: positive loss contributions reserve immediately; hedge benefit occurs only on completion; collateral encumbrance remains until a later measured baseline; no pending hedge offsets are netted into new trade capacity; no unexecuted position backs a hedge.").

requirement('A-WINDOW', 'api:28', "A submit prunes the oldest retained record when 256 are retained and it is terminal; while it is open submit fails Full, even if the other 255 are terminal; every call on a pruned id fails NotFound, including a repeated executor settle.").

requirement('A-EXECUTOR', 'api:40', "execute({id,recipe,units}) -> active | cancelled | unknown, only the lock may call; status({id}) also returns completed; any result that is not one JSON string of at most 64 bytes, and any unexpected string, becomes Unknown in the wrapper.").
requirement('A-EXEC-WINDOW', 'api:42', "The synthetic adapter forgets a job once its id is 256 or more behind its newest id; execute of a forgotten id returns cancelled and starts nothing; on_settled raises the newest id only if the lock accepted; at most 512 jobs.").
requirement('A-GAS', 'api:46', "Attach at least the documented prepaid gas; a call with too little gas fails without changing either contract.").

# Which near-approval CI jobs a change needs. Reads changed paths (one per
# line, repo-relative, as `git diff --name-only` prints them) on stdin and
# prints `<job>=true|false` for each gated job, for $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
#
# The rules list what each path can affect; a path no rule names runs every
# job, so a new file or directory is checked until someone narrows it here.
# The pin job is not gated: it always runs (status.toml, the gitlink).

# usage: git diff --name-only BASE HEAD | tools/scripts/ci-areas.sh

#        CI_AREAS_EXPLAIN=1 ...              (also each path's jobs on stderr)
